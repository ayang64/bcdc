					Thank you for your support.  We are currently closed for business.
					We will probably re-open to sell our handguard grip tape accessories
					by January.  We <i>might</i> resume selling guns and accessories by
					2019.

					We're working on a revamped website.  You can
					<a href='https://github.com/ayang64/bcdc'>keep track of the source code</a>
					if you like.
